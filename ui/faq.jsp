		"Helios was built to provide high-availability, data source-independent, \"realest\"-time visibility into the massive amounts of data accumulated during the " +

		"Easy. Navigate to the <a href=\"index.jsp\">Home</a> page and click on a report link for a report you seek. The report will launch and prompt you for any required " +

		"The scope and size of the data, as well as the level of accuracy necessitated by business decisions, requires an attention to detail that only software can relabily provide." +
